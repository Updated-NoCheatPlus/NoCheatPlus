/**
 * Aim of this class is to provide a quick'n'dirty way of handling movements that cannot be predicted through ordinary means (not necessarily elegance), thus resorting to hard-coded magic.<br>
 * A few things to keep in mind:
 * <li> Before adding a workaround, you should attempt to handle the movement as intended by the client (or at as closely as NCP's infrastructure will allow): falling back to a workaround should be the last resort.</li>
 * <li> Each workaround must have proper documentation. Emphasis on "why" the workaround is needed in the first place.</li>
 * <li> Our aim is to nerf / limit what cheaters can do, not catching every single kind of cheat implementation. </li>
 * With this premise in mind then, a workaround should have limited room for exploitation: we prefer players not having to deal with false positives than catching low-level cheats in this instance.
 *    (If possible, do give an example on what kind of exploits might be enabled by the workaround)</li>
 * <li> Avoid adding too many [and nested, more than 2] conditions (like it was prior to the vDistRel rework). </li>
 * <li> To keep a better track / overview of workarounds, do make use of the workaround registry (append the "use" after all conditions. See the doc for it) </li>
